# Security & Privacy

## Privacy-First Architecture

This application demonstrates a commitment to user privacy through thoughtful technical design decisions:

## Privacy-First Architecture

DevPulse is designed with privacy and security as core principles:

### Your Data Stays Local
- **Everything local**: All data stored on your device using SQLite
- **No cloud sync**: Nothing gets uploaded anywhere
- **No tracking**: No analytics, no telemetry, no sneaky stuff
- **You control it**: Export, delete, or modify your data anytime

### What Permissions It Needs
- **Screen recording** (macOS): To detect what apps you're using
- **File access**: To see what projects you're working on
- **Network** (optional): Only if you enable GitHub integration

## Security Stuff

### How It's Protected
- **Open source**: You can see exactly what it does
- **Minimal dependencies**: Less code = fewer potential issues
- **Local encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted on your device
- **Clean code**: Follows security best practices

### GitHub Integration (Optional)
If you want to connect GitHub (totally optional):
- Uses standard OAuth2 for secure login
- Only asks for minimal permissions
- Tokens stored encrypted on your device
- Can disconnect anytime
- All analysis happens locally

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

Security issues are taken seriously and addressed promptly:

### Reporting Process
- **GitHub Issues**: For general security discussions and non-sensitive concerns
- **Private Contact**: For sensitive vulnerabilities requiring confidential disclosure
- **Required Information**: Detailed reproduction steps, impact assessment, and affected versions

All reports are acknowledged within 24 hours with resolution timelines based on severity.

## Security Best Practices

### User Guidelines
- Download exclusively from official GitHub releases
- Maintain current system updates
- Regularly audit granted application permissions
- Implement local data backup strategies

### Development Standards
- Maintain current dependency versions
- Implement security-conscious feature development
- Comprehensive testing including security scenarios

## Project Philosophy

This project exemplifies privacy-by-design principles in modern application development. The architecture ensures complete data locality with transparent, auditable code and sustainable development practices.

Security concerns and improvement suggestions are actively monitored and addressed through GitHub's issue tracking system.
