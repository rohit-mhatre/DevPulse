# DevPulse Deployment Strategy & CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This document outlines the deployment strategy and CI/CD pipeline for DevPulse, focusing on rapid development cycles and continuous delivery within our 6-day sprint methodology.

## Deployment Architecture

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for testing
- **Production**: Live application environment

### Infrastructure Components
- **Frontend**: React application with Vite build system
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery optimization

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Code Integration
**Trigger**: Push to feature branch or main
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Build artifact generation

### Stage 2: Staging Deployment
**Trigger**: Merge to main branch
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run smoke tests and health checks
- Performance testing and monitoring
- Manual QA validation checkpoint

### Stage 3: Production Deployment
**Trigger**: Manual approval or tag creation
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Database migration execution
- Health check validation
- Rollback capability ready
- Monitoring and alerting activation

### Stage 4: Post-Deployment
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User analytics collection
- Automated backup verification

## Build & Test Strategy

### Build Process
```yaml
Build Steps:
1. Install dependencies (npm ci)
2. Run linting and formatting checks
3. Execute test suites
4. Build production assets
5. Generate deployment artifacts
6. Create Docker images
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Component and function level testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint and database testing
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing on staging
- **Security Tests**: Dependency and code vulnerability scans

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Database connection strings
- API keys and secrets (managed via secret manager)
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Monitoring and logging configuration

### Infrastructure as Code
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- Kubernetes manifests for orchestration
- Terraform for cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Helm charts for application deployment

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- Error rate and response time tracking
- User session and conversion analytics
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Alerting Strategy
- Critical error notifications
- Performance degradation alerts
- Security incident detection
- Deployment status updates

## Rollback & Recovery

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical bugs in production
- Performance degradation beyond thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Failed health checks post-deployment

### Recovery Process
1. Immediate traffic routing to previous version
2. Database rollback if schema changes involved
3. Cache invalidation and cleanup
4. Incident communication to stakeholders
5. Post-mortem analysis and prevention measures
