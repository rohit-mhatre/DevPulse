| Initial Load | 6.2s | 3s | ❌ 206% over |
| API Response | 27ms | 200ms | ✅ 86% under |
| Memory Usage | 1.2GB | 250MB | ❌ 480% over |
| Database Query | 30ms | 50ms | ✅ 40% under |

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Performance Alerts to Implement:
- Memory usage > 85%
- API response time > 500ms
- Bundle size > 1MB
- LCP > 3.0s
- Database query time > 100ms

### Metrics to Track:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- API response times (p95, p99)
- Memory usage trends
- Database performance metrics

## Conclusion

DevPulse shows excellent database performance but requires immediate attention for frontend optimization and system resource management. The 22MB bundle size and 99.6% memory usage are critical issues that must be addressed before production deployment.

**Recommended Action Plan:**
1. **Week 1**: Address memory pressure and bundle optimization
2. **Week 2**: API performance improvements and monitoring
3. **Week 3**: Frontend performance optimization
4. **Week 4**: System architecture improvements

The system is functionally complete but requires significant performance optimization before production readiness.
